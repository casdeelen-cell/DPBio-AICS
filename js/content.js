      heading: "Water as a polar molecule",
      level: "SL",
      text: "Water's biological importance starts with its shape and its chemistry. A water molecule is bent at an angle of roughly 104.5 degrees, with two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to a central oxygen. Oxygen has a higher **electronegativity** than hydrogen, so it pulls the shared electrons in each O-H bond closer to itself. This produces an uneven distribution of charge across the molecule: the oxygen end carries a partial negative charge and each hydrogen carries a partial positive charge.\n\nA molecule with this kind of unequal charge distribution is described as a **polar molecule**. It is worth being precise with terminology here: water is not ionic and does not carry a full charge, the polarity arises purely from unequal sharing of electrons within covalent bonds. Almost every property of water covered in this topic, its role as a solvent, its cohesion, its thermal behaviour, traces back to this single structural feature.",

      heading: "Hydrogen bonding",
      level: "SL",
      text: "Because each water molecule carries both a positive and a negative region, molecules can attract one another: the positive hydrogen of one molecule is drawn to the negative oxygen of a neighbouring molecule. This intermolecular attraction is called a **hydrogen bond**.\n\nA hydrogen bond is considerably weaker than a covalent bond, roughly one-twentieth of the strength, and each individual bond is short-lived, breaking and reforming on a picosecond timescale. What matters biologically is the cumulative effect: at any given moment, a water molecule in liquid water is hydrogen bonded to an average of about 3.4 other molecules, and this constant, dynamic network of bonds is what gives bulk water its unusual physical properties compared to similarly sized molecules."

      heading: "Cohesion and its consequences",
      level: "SL",
      text: "**Cohesion** refers to the mutual attraction between molecules of the same substance. In water, cohesion arises directly from hydrogen bonding, and it has several consequences that are directly relevant to living systems.\n\nThe clearest example is water transport in the xylem of vascular plants. As water evaporates from the mesophyll cells of a leaf during **transpiration**, it is replaced by water pulled up from the xylem below. Because the water molecules in the xylem are hydrogen bonded to one another, they behave as a continuous, unbroken column, so the loss of water at the top of the plant creates a pull that is transmitted all the way down to the roots. This is the basis of the cohesion-tension theory of water transport, and it explains how trees move water to heights of over 100 metres without any active pumping mechanism.\n\nCohesion is also responsible for **surface tension**, the tendency of a water surface to behave like a stretched elastic sheet. This is strong enough to support the weight of small organisms, such as pond skaters, that would otherwise sink.",

      heading: "Adhesion",
      level: "SL",
      text: "**Adhesion** is the attraction between water molecules and a different polar or charged surface, rather than between water molecules themselves. Inside a xylem vessel, water adheres to the cellulose and lignin of the vessel walls, which helps counteract the downward pull of gravity on the water column.\n\nCohesion and adhesion act together to produce **capillary action**, the tendency of water to rise up narrow tubes. This is a measurable contributor to water movement in short plants and in the initial uptake of water from soil into root hairs, though for tall trees, transpiration pull dominates.",
      tip: { label: "Common mistake", text: "Cohesion is water sticking to water. Adhesion is water sticking to something else. Students frequently swap these two definitions under exam pressure, so it helps to have a fixed example memorised for each." }

      heading: "Water as a solvent",
      level: "SL",
      text: "Polar and charged (ionic) substances tend to dissolve readily in water, because individual water molecules can surround a solute particle, with their negative oxygen oriented towards a positive ion or their positive hydrogens oriented towards a negative ion. This process, called hydration, effectively pulls the substance apart and disperses it through the solution.\n\nThis solvent property makes water the medium in which the great majority of metabolic reactions take place; enzymes, substrates and products are almost always dissolved in the aqueous cytoplasm. It is equally why blood plasma can transport glucose, amino acids, and ions around the body, and why the phloem of a plant can carry dissolved sucrose between source and sink tissues.\n\nNon-polar substances, such as lipids, do not dissolve in water. This is not a side note, it is the entire reason that lipid bilayers can function as membranes: a barrier that is impermeable to most polar and charged solutes is exactly what a cell needs to control its internal environment (see B2.1)."

      heading: "Thermal properties and aquatic habitats",
      level: "HL",
      text: "The extensive hydrogen bonding in water also accounts for its thermal behaviour, which is relevant to the way organisms experience aquatic and terrestrial environments differently.\n\nWater has a high **specific heat capacity**: a relatively large amount of energy is required to raise its temperature, because much of the input energy goes into breaking hydrogen bonds rather than increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules. Large bodies of water therefore change temperature slowly, buffering aquatic organisms against the rapid daily and seasonal temperature swings that terrestrial organisms must cope with.\n\nWater also has a high latent heat of vaporisation, meaning evaporation removes a large amount of energy from the remaining liquid. This is the physical basis of cooling by sweating and by transpiration. Finally, hydrogen bonding causes ice to be less dense than liquid water, since the bonds hold molecules in a more open lattice arrangement when frozen. Ice therefore floats, insulating the liquid water beneath it and allowing aquatic life to persist under a frozen surface rather than the entire body of water freezing solid from the bottom up."

      heading: "The phospholipid bilayer",
      level: "SL",
      text: "Every biological membrane is built around a **phospholipid** bilayer, two layers of phospholipid molecules arranged tail to tail. A phospholipid has a polar, hydrophilic phosphate head and two non-polar, hydrophobic fatty acid tails. When phospholipids are placed in an aqueous environment, they spontaneously arrange themselves so the polar heads face outward, in contact with the water on either side of the membrane, and the non-polar tails cluster together, shielded from water in the interior of the bilayer.\n\nThis arrangement is thermodynamically favourable and requires no cellular machinery to assemble, it is a direct consequence of the amphipathic structure of phospholipids and their interaction with water. The result is a continuous, self-sealing barrier that separates the inside of a cell (or organelle) from its surroundings.",

      heading: "The fluid mosaic model",
      level: "SL",
      text: "The **fluid mosaic model**, proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972, describes the arrangement and behaviour of membrane components. It is described as a mosaic because proteins, cholesterol, and glycolipids are embedded at different points and depths throughout the bilayer, producing a patchy, varied composition rather than a uniform sheet. It is described as fluid because individual phospholipids and proteins are not fixed in place, they can diffuse laterally within their own layer, giving the membrane flexibility and self-repairing properties.\n\n**Integral proteins** are embedded within the bilayer, often spanning it completely, while **peripheral proteins** are attached more loosely to just one face of the membrane. Membrane proteins carry out much of the functional work of a membrane, including transport, enzymatic catalysis, receptor binding for cell signalling, and cell-to-cell recognition."

      heading: "Simple diffusion and osmosis",

      text: "Small, non-polar molecules, notably oxygen and carbon dioxide, can cross the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer directly. This is **simple diffusion**: net movement from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, requiring no protein and no energy input, since it is driven entirely by the **concentration gradient**.\n\n**Osmosis** is the diffusion of water specifically, across a partially permeable membrane, from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration. Although water is a polar molecule, small amounts can cross the bilayer directly, and this is substantially assisted in most cells by aquaporins, channel proteins specialised for water transport."

      heading: "Facilitated diffusion",
      level: "SL",
      text: "Polar molecules and ions cannot cross the non-polar core of the bilayer at a biologically useful rate, so their movement depends on membrane proteins. **Facilitated diffusion** uses two classes of protein: channel proteins, which form a hydrophilic pore that allows specific ions or molecules through, and carrier proteins, which bind their target molecule and undergo a conformational change to move it across the membrane.\n\nCrucially, facilitated diffusion is still a form of **passive transport**: movement occurs down the concentration gradient, and no ATP is consumed, even though a protein is required to make the crossing possible."

      label: "5",
      heading: "Active transport",
      level: "SL",
      text: "When a substance needs to move against its concentration gradient, from a region of lower to higher concentration, energy input is required. This is **active transport**, and it is carried out by pump proteins that use ATP directly to drive a conformational change.\n\nThe sodium-potassium pump is the standard example: for each cycle, it moves three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions in, both against their respective gradients, using the energy released from hydrolysing one molecule of ATP. This pump is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential in neurons and for driving secondary active transport of other solutes, such as glucose reabsorption in the kidney nephron."

      heading: "Bulk transport: endocytosis and exocytosis",
      level: "HL",
      text: "Some material is too large to cross a membrane through an individual protein, and instead requires bulk transport using vesicles. In **endocytosis**, a region of the membrane invaginates around extracellular material and pinches off to form an intracellular vesicle. In **exocytosis**, an intracellular vesicle moves to the membrane and fuses with it, releasing its contents to the exterior of the cell.\n\nBoth processes require energy and are essential for handling material too large for channel or carrier proteins, for example the secretion of protein hormones or neurotransmitters, or the uptake of large extracellular particles by phagocytic immune cells.",

The possible gametes each parent can produce, and the possible genotype combinations in the offspring, can be predicted systematically using a Punnett grid.\n\nCrossing two heterozygotes for a gene with simple dominant/recessive inheritance produces the classic 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the offspring, three individuals showing the dominant phenotype for every one showing the recessive phenotype. This ratio is a probability, describing the expected outcome across a large number of offspring, not a guaranteed outcome for any small sample.",

Three alleles exist for this gene: IA and IB, which are codominant with one another, and i, which is recessive to both.

This explains why conditions such as red-green colour blindness and haemophilia occur substantially more often in males than in females, and why they characteristically appear to skip a generation when carried, unexpressed, by a heterozygous ('carrier') female.",
